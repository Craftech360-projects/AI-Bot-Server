    Creates a conversational retrieval chain using the provided vector store.
    This chain will be used to answer user queries based on the uploaded documents.
    
     conversational retrieval chain
    
    llm: This is the language model that will generate the responses. In your case, llm is an instance of the ChatGroq model.
        chain_type: This specifies how the retrieved documents are combined with the user's question before being passed to the LLM.
    Possible Values:
    "stuff": The retrieved documents are concatenated together ("stuffed") and passed to the language model as a single input.
    "map_reduce": The retrieved documents are processed in smaller chunks. The LLM generates answers for each chunk, and then these answers are aggregated (reduced) to form the final response.
    "refine": The initial response is generated based on the first retrieved document, and then subsequent documents are used to refine that answer.

    Effect: The "stuff" chain type is generally faster but may be limited by the LLM's context window (the maximum amount of text the model can process at once). This method works well when the amount of relevant text is relatively small.



    c. retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 2})
    retriever: This defines how the documents are retrieved based on the user's query.
    vector_store.as_retriever(): This method converts the vector_store (which holds the document embeddings) into a retriever object. The retriever is responsible for finding the most relevant document chunks based on the user's question.
    search_kwargs={"k": 2}: This parameter specifies additional options for the retrieval process:
    k: This indicates the number of top results to return from the vector store. In this case, it will retrieve the top 2 most relevant document chunks.
    Effect: Setting k=2 means that for every query, the retriever will find the top 2 most relevant pieces of text. These pieces will then be fed into the language model to help generate an informed response. The higher the value of k, the more text is retrieved, which can improve the response quality but may also make the process slower and more resource-intensive.
    
    
     memory=memory
    memory: This manages the conversation history, ensuring the chatbot can maintain context across multiple interactions.
    ConversationBufferMemory: The specific memory type you're using, ConversationBufferMemory, stores all the messages exchanged in the conversation (both from the user and the bot).
    Effect: By using this memory, the chatbot can generate responses that consider the entire conversation history, not just the most recent user input. This is crucial for maintaining coherent and contextually appropriate conversations, especially in multi-turn dialogues.
